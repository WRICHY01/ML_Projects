In Arden's shade, a tragic flower,
Ophelia, in her gentle hour,
A maiden fair, with heart so pure,
By love undone, she could not endure.

Her father's will, a brother's plea,
A lover's madness, wild and free,
Caught in a web of sorrow's sting,
Her fragile soul began to sing.

With garlands woven, tears like dew,
She danced to madness, skies of blue,
Into the stream, a watery bed,
Where willow branches softly spread.

A Ophelia, gone too soon,
Beneath the pale and silent moon,
Your tragic tale, a whispered sigh,
A gentle spirit, soaring high.
