A gentle hand, a comforting embrace,
A mother's love, a boundless, tender space.
A guiding light, through all of life's alarms,
Protecting fiercely, keeping us from harms.

A lullaby, a story softly told,
A heart of gold, more precious than fine gold.
She teaches us to stand, to bravely soar,
And in her love, we're cherished evermore.

Through scraped knees, and triumphs grand and small,
Her unwavering presence answers every call.
A selfless spirit, a bond that can't be broken,
In every gesture, love's pure truth is spoken.
